# The Mathematics of Wikipedia
This contains the code used to construct and analyze a subgraph of Wikipedia specifically designed to be mathematics-related. 
The project was a final project for the Network Science class at Harvey Mudd College, additionally involving a presentation and a write-up. 

Our full category graph can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Q4bllbuoalgU-tlEzLB4U6xAXjy72tT/view?usp=sharing). This is a directed graph where an edge is formed between a category and its subcategory.

The induced page graph can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/180UxSj0cRYDOtJqKAStSp_wkWnXmmMoP/view?usp=drive_link) and contains the mathematics subgraph of Wikipedia. In particular, it is the page graph formed containing all pages instead every category in the categories graph. The graph is directed, and contains a edge between two nodes if one page links to the other.
